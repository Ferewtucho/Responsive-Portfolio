                <p>I was born in the capital city of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa. I moved to the United States in 2009 along with
                    my parents and my younger sister. My parents made the decision to move to the United States in search
                    of a better opportunity for their children. Once we moved to the United States there were many hardships
                    in terms of the language barrier and finding a stable job to support the family. I took the responsibility
                    of taking care of my younger sister and I chose to work instead of being fully invested in school.</p>

                <p>Once I made the decision to go to college, I went to the Community College of Philadelphia to pursue nursing.
                    I chose to pursue nursing as my major because I received many pressures from my family and I gave in.
                    After two years in Community College, I got accepted at Jefferson, but the lack of interest that I had
                    for this field, I wasnâ€™t motivated enough to pursue a field in nursing and continue studying this major.
                    I decided to fully focus on my work as a zone manager at Paradise lagardere.</p>

                <p>Now that my family is financially stable and more independent. I am taking this time to pursue my interest
                    and for once in my life make a selfish move to go back to school and follow my dream as a web developer.
                    </p>
